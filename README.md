# Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
**What is credit card fraud detection?**
The term "credit card fraud detection" refers to the collection of procedures, methods, instruments, and regulations used by financial institutions and credit card issuers to thwart identity theft and halt fraudulent transactions.
With the explosion of data and the rise in credit card transactions in recent years, credit fraud detection has mostly moved online and into automation. The majority of contemporary systems use machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to handle decision-making, data analysis, predictive modeling, fraud alerts, and remedial actions that are taken after specific credit card fraud cases are found.
